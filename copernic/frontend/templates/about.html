            Versioning in production systems is a trick everybody knows
            about whether it is through backup, logging systems and ad-hoc
            audit trails. It allows to inspect, debug and in worst cases
            rollback to previous states. There is not need to explain the
            great importance of versioning in software management as tools
            like git, mercurial, and fossil have shaped modern computing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having the power of versioning open the door to
            manyfold applications. Like, it allows to implement a
            mechanic similar to github's pull requests and gitlab's
            merge requests in many products. That very mechanic is
            explicit about the actual human workflow in entreprise
            settings, in particular, when a person validates a change
            made by another person.
        </p>

        <p>
            The versioned triple store make the implementation of
            such mechanics more systematic and less error prone as the
            implementation can be shared across various tools and
            organisations.
        </p>

        <p>
            copernic takes the path of versioning data and apply
            the change-request mechanic to collaborate around the
            making of a knowledge base, similar in spirit to WikiData
            and inspired from existing data management systems like
            CKAN.
        </p>

        <p>
            The use of a version control system to store open data
            is a good thing as it draws a clear path for reproducible
            science. But none, meets all the expectations. copernic
            aims to replace the use of git and <b>make practical
            cooperation around the creation, publication, storage,
            re-use and maintenance of knowledge bases</b> that are
            possibly bigger than memory. Resource Description
            Framework (RDF) offers a good canvas for cooperation
            around open data but there is no solution that is good
            enough according to Collaborative Open Data versioning: a
            pragmatic approach using Linked Data, by Canova et al.
        </p>

        <p>
            copernic use a novel approach to store triples in an
            ordered key-value store. It use FoundationDB database
            storage engine to deliver a pragmatic versatile
            ACID-compliant versioned triple store where people can
            cooperate around the making of knowledge. copernic only
            stores changes between versions. copernic does not rely on
            the theory of patches introduced by Darcs but re-use some
            its vocabulary. copernic is the future.
